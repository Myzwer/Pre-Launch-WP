Wordpress Pre-Launch is a VERY beginnger friendly wordpress template built on webpack. It makes use of webpack, Babel, Sass, Tailwind, Browsersync, PostCSS, ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier and more. And if you have no idea what any of that is, then this is the template for you.

## Features and Benefits
**General**

- [**Webpack.**](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/webpack) Built on webpack, this template allows for a modern development workflow + a production ready build.
- **Minification.** Complete with webpack's native features and CSSNano, this gets your CSS and JS files smaller than things in 40 degree water.
- [**Prettier.**](https://prettier.io/) An opinionated code formatter. It automagically formats all your code on save so that it always looks the same. This forces everyone's code to look the same, so no more arguing about tabs vs spaces.
- [**BrowserSync.**](https://browsersync.io/) Browsersync synchronises browsers, URLs, interactions and code changes across devices and automatically refreshes all the browsers on all devices on changes. If you have never used this it'll blow your mind.
- [**Sourcemaps.**]() Webpack generates sourcemaps for all js and css files. This helps with debugging simply because when you don't have them enabled your code hides from you like slenderman.
- Configuration. All of the config files have been neatly organized into /webpack to keep them out of the way of the main files. Webpack.config being the exception.

**CSS**

- [**PostCSS.**](http://postcss.org/) PostCSS allows for some code to be injected after the fact, most noteably...
- [**Autoprefixer.**](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) Remember those CSS vendor prefixes you didn't add? Well autoprefixer has you covered.
- [**TailwindCSS.**](https://tailwindcss.com/) Tailwind is the CSS framework all the kids are tweeting about. If you aren't familiar, it basically generates like 4.8 million CSS classes so you never have to write CSS again. And it cleans up after itself, which is nice.
- [**Sass.**](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/sass-loader/) Technicaly SCSS. But we call it sass. Compiles Sass down into CSS so browsers can read it.

**JS**

- [**BabelJS.**](https://babeljs.io/) Allows you to use next gen Javascript by transpiling it (dumbing it down) to something IE 4 can understand (that claim isn't tested).

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

# Section 1: I Know What I'm Doing.

You've got it then. 

```bash
# 1-- Set up a local instance of Worpress in Local or something.
# 2-- Clone this into your themes folder (as a new theme)

$ git clone https://github.com/Myzwer/Pre-Launch-WP.git

# 2-- Edit the BrowserSync settings in `webpack.config.js`. Ya can't miss it.
# 3-- Install yarn and all the project dependencies

$ yarn install

# 4-- Run a command and start making some magic.
yarn dev
yarn dev:watch
yarn prod
yarn prod:watch
```

# Section 2: Lol I have no idea what I'm doing.

Good. You're like me. This guide aims to be pretty extensive, so buckle up. Some of this might already be up and running on your machine, and that's great, but this guide assumes you are starting from scratch. If you haven't gathered it already, I have a pretty unique sense of humor, but hopefully it makes this more fun to read. Or maybe Comedy Central will give me a call if this doesn't work out.

Couple Notes before we start:

- I am developing on a MacBook Pro running Catalina. If you are developing on a mac, everything should be the same, but Windows users might have other issues. At this time I do not have the bandwidth to check for issues / incompatibilities on windows. Sorry. :(
- If the rest of this seems hella incomplete, it probably is. I am currently pushing new commits pretty frequently, and so guides will come with that.
- While the aim of this guide is to help users get set up as much as possible, I am not going to cover how to build out a complete theme in WordPress. The goal is to get you from 0 to a working template, then run on your own. I will happily link resources on how to do things when appropriate.

**This is still a work in progress. I plan to write a lot more, but it's going to be as I go. The template is usable, but the readme is still under construction. ðŸš§ Bear with me as this is updated.**

***
# Getting started.
In order to develop in wordpress, you need a couple things in place on your computer already. This is where (in my opinion) the process falls apart for a lot of new developers. It's very easy here to jump into a rabit hold of "you need X"...which requires Y, which requires Z, and so on. So while you may need other things in the future, let's start at the top. If you have some of these already, yay, you're ahead of me. If you don't, hop along for the ride.

### ALL the browers
- Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera... you need them all to do effective development. Might as well go get them now.

### Something to edit code with
- You want to see people at each other's throats more than talking about politics? Walk into stackoverflow and ask front end devs what the best code editor / IDE is. (NOTE: Not all the editors on the list are IDE's (Integrated Development Environment), and that's ok.).
- What you choose comes down to your budget and your preference. There is no right or wrong way to choose.
- Options
  - Visual Studio Code - far and away the most popular - free - takes some degree of work to setup all the plugins for it
  - PhpStorm / Webstorm - incredibly powerful out of the box features - expensive - choose which you like more based on how much php or js you'll be writing.
  - Sublime Text 3 - Simple editor, easy to understand - free - Takes some setup for more advanced features
  - Anything else - Use whatever makes you happy. You can always switch later. Just make sure it has some degree of syntax highlighting, or you'll hate yourself very soon.

### Iterm2
- You don't technically * NEED * this, as the terminal on your computer already works fine. But if you want to customize colors, get autocomplete, etc, go ahead and grab this software, we'll use it later. 

### Local by Flywheel
- While there are other options, I can't recommend Local enough. 
- "What's a local?"
- Flywheel is a company that hosts managed wordpress (I also recommend, but that's not the scope here) and they made a tool for developers called "local." It basically spins up a wordpress instance on your computer with a few clicks. It requires almost no brainpower on your part. 
- If you want to be difficult you can just MAMP, but... don't.

### Xcode (mac)
- Xcode is a program from the mac store that you will download and forget about, but it installs some stuff that we can then use later. 
- You will literally never launch the program after you download it that first time, but it's necessary. Maybe someone smarter than me can tell you why. Who tf knows. Just do it. You can always uninstall it later if I'm wrong. 

### Homebrew
- Homebrew is a piece of software that acts as a portal for us to download other software via the command line. Which sounds scary but this makes things really easy to do.

### NodeJS
- A lot of dev tools need this, might as well get it out of the way now.
- Grab the installer of their website, it really helps the process. Just do what it says. 

## That's it for the apps. Onto the tools. 

- Most of what is coming up will be done via command line. ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±
- Yes, if you've never worked with it, it's scary. It sure SEEMS like you can destroy your entire computer by typing in the wrong thing, but I assure you they've made it not easy to do that. Ever tried to clean up storage space on your computer? You get me. 
- Couple commands you need to know: [Read This](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/web-designers-essential-command-lines/).
- Highlights
  - `cd` means change directory, it switches your folder (PRO TIP: You can drag and drop a folder from finder)
  - `mkdir` mean made folder. It.. makes a folder wherever you currently are. 
  - `touch` means make a new file where you are. so `touch cats.txt` will make a folder called cats.txt wherever you currently are.
  - `ls` means list directory. Basically it spits out whatever files exist in the area you are.
- Note, you can also check if something installed right by adding `-v` or `-version` to the end of the name.
- `git -version` should spit out `git version 2.24.3 (Apple Git-128)`.

### Git
- Hopefully you at least know what git is, but it's a bit confusing * what * it is. 
- **Git Â± Github.** They aren't the same thing. This took me 5 years to understand. Git is what you install on your machine to keep track of file changes and such, Github is merely a "host" for git, and displays it in a pretty way. 
- **YOU CAN USE GIT WITHOUT GITHUB, YOU CANNOT USE GITHUB WITHOUT GIT.**
- I'm done ranting just watch [this video.](https://youtu.be/2ReR1YJrNOM)
- We will use homebrew to install git, so pop open terminal, make sure you are in root (type `cd` then press enter)
- Type
  - `brew install git`
- Watch the magic. Boom. Now git is installed and can work on your machine. 

### Node
- This comes with npm, ironically something for use later to install more stuff. 90% of web development is just installing crap.
- Made sure you are in root directory `cd`.
- `brew install node`
- Done. Easy.

### Yarn
- Also a thing we will use later (this project uses yarn). It does the same thing as npm, it installs stuff, I just prefer yarn for reasons outside the scope of this. Regardless, you'll have both installed.
- `brew install yarn` in command line and call it a day.

## And we are done. You are ready to start developing. 
By this point you should have installed:
- A bunch of browsers
- Something to edit code with
- Iterm2 (if you want it)
- Local By Flywheel
- Xcode (mac only)
- Homebrew
- NodeJS
- Git
- Node
- Yarn

Seems like a lot but it's very much a one and done kind of thing. Time to start developing. 

# Setup Wordpress Environment
- Create a folder to hold the website. If this folder is in your desktop or downloads photo uninstall all this and get a new job. DON'T. do this. File management will save yourself later. Do it right now.
- Launch Local.
- Hit the green + In the corner and create a new website. 
- Give it a name.
- Click advanced options
- Change your local site path to the file you created before.
- Don't use a blueprint, you don't have one. 
- Next page, click preferred, you don't have anything you need to change here. 
- Next page, create a username and password.
- Create your site!

### Viola! You now have a wordpress website.
- If you click "view site" in local, you can see it up and running. 
- However, we want THIS theme, not twenty whatever theme.
- So, in terminal, navigate down the rabithole to get to your themes folder. 
- Should be something like
  - `whateverfolderyoumade/app/public/wp-content/themes`
- Now, in there you should see a few folders of themes.

- We now need to get this theme off of github and onto your computer in the right spot.
- Option 1: Download it as a zip file, unzip and drag and drop into `/themes`.
- Option 2 (the better way, albiet more difficult): Now that you are in `/themes` in your terminal,  type this code:
  - `git clone https://github.com/Myzwer/Pre-Launch-WP.git`
- This will create a new folder called prelaunch-wp and it will have the theme in it. Simple as that. 

### Run the installs
- This theme uses a bunch of stuff, and we need to install it, every single time. Navigate from `/themes` into prelaunch-wp.
  - `cd /pre-launch-wp`
- Type
  - `yarn install`
- Pray everything works because there's like 40 fail points from here. It will succeed with warnings, but it shouldn't fail out. If it does, put on your googling hat, find the place that threw the error, and start googling what the problem is. Best of luck. 
- If it installs correctly, then we are almost there.

### Webpack Proxy
- Sounds complicated, really isn't.
- Open your code in whatever program you chose before.
- Find `webpack.config.js`. Open that file.
- At the time of this writing, the line you are looking for is 130. 
- It says:
  - `proxy: "https://prelaunch.local",`
- Once you find it, reopen local, and check "Site Domain" at the top. It should be whatever you called it with `.local` on the end.
- Replace the url on line 130 with that new URL.

### Change the theme in WP Admin
- Use local to launch WP Admin
- Login.
- Go to Appearance, and change the theme to Pre-Launch WP.

### Launch the site with Browsersync
- Go back to iTerm2, and assuming you did all the other steps correctly...
  - `yarn dev:watch`
- If all is right, after a few seconds a webpage should open showing you the pre-launch homepage, and live-reload + browsersync should be on as well. Meaning if you make a change and save it, it will update itself. 
- Happy coding!

# Wordpress is installed... now what?
The following sections cover various things you might need to know how to do in the future. They are in no particular order, and mostly specific to this theme. General wordpress build stuff can come from people who are a LOT smarter than I.

# How To Add Fonts To Your Project
### Google Fonts
1. Go to https://fonts.google.com/
2. Pick a font family that you like, and select a few styles. (as a note, the more files you choose the slower the site will be. So only pick ones you need to use)
3. Under "use on the web" section, make sure < link > is selected, and look at the code that is generated. It should look _something_ like this: 
```
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,500;0,700;1,400&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
4. Copy the link from the 3rd block, minus the &display=swap. In the example above, it would be this:
```css
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,500;0,700;1,400
```
5. Navigate to functions.php, specifically the fonts part.
6. Drop in this code:
```php
wp_register_style( 'FONTNAME_font', 'FONTLINK' );
wp_enqueue_style('FONTNAME_font');
```
7. Name it whatever where FONTNAME_font is (it doesn't matter what you call it, but it does make sense to name it the fontname for ease of reference later), and add the link to FONTLINK. So to complete our example:
```php
wp_register_style( 'roboto_font', 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?familY=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,500;0,700;1,400' );
wp_enqueue_style('roboto_font');
```
8. Go back to google, copy the font family section and you can begin using it in your CSS!
9. (optional) If you are still using tailwind, go into tailwind.config.js and update the fontFamily section. This is already done for you so you should be able to easily swap out my code for your new font code.
```css
fontFamily: {
       'myfontname': ['Roboto', 'sans-serif'], // text-roboto
      }
  ```
---
### Custom Fonts
1. Purchase or download font files. They will most likely come as .otf or .ttf or something like that. It doesn't matter which you use. 
2. Go to [Transfonter](https://transfonter.org/) and select the fontses you want to include. The more files you include the slower your website will be, so only get the ones you need. Bigger is not always better. Girls do care about the [size of your megapixel.](https://youtu.be/eg8u_Q1tNlo?t=22)
3. Upload the font files to the site.
4. You do not need to adjust any settings on the bottom section unless you want to.
5. Download your @font-face kit zip file with new fonts!
6. Upzip. ðŸ˜‰
7. You don't need demo.html, though can see what your fonts looks like on a page if you load it up. 
8. Copy all .woff and .woff2 files into ./assets/src/webfonts in the wordpress project. You can delete any existing files that you no longer need including the gitkeep file.
9. Open up stylesheet.css, copy all the code out of it, and paste that into fonts.css. (.assets/src/sass/fonts/)
10. Lastly, you'll need to tell your fonts where they can find the woff files. This means adding ``../../webfonts/`` to the beginnging of all of your URL's.
```css
font-family: "MYFONT";
  src: url("../../webfonts/MYFONT.woff2") format("woff2"),
    url("../../webfonts/MYFONT.woff") format("woff");
  font-weight: 900;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
```
11. Once added, if you have prettier and stylelint up and running, both of those will throw errors, so hop over to iterm and type ``yarn stylelint`` to get it fixed. 
12. Once linked like this, you are free to use your new font families! The name is whatever fontfamily is called. In the above example (where I showed linking) MYFONT would be the name you'd use. 
13. (optional) If you are still using tailwind, go into tailwind.config.js and update the fontFamily section. This is already done for you so you should be able to easily swap out my code for your new font code.
```css
fontFamily: {
       'myfontname': ['Bleeding Cowboy', 'serif'], // text-bleeding-cowboy
      }
  ```
# Navbar - Header.php
<img src = "https://i.imgflip.com/5ku7z5.jpg" width= 50%; alt = "What the hell happened here?">

So if you've never had the pleasure of creating a navbar before, it's a tossup between creating one and getting waterboarded for me. They are miserable to deal with for a couple reasons. They are already finicky enough without introducing wordpress into the mixture. 

Wait, what do you mean "in wordpress"? I mean that your navbar isn't much good if the URL's are only work on local or production, but not both. Or if the user can't go in and edit a link like they wanted to. So we build it In wordpress, meaning we use php to generate the navbar code on the server side, rather than a whole bunch of HTML. However, wordpress has a very specific way of outputing code, and it is without fail NEVER the code you needed it to be. So we use a custom navwalker to fix this. 

That sounds complicated. It was, luckily it's done for you. The navbar is plug and play as is, right now. 

*** IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS NAVBAR DOES NOT USE TAILWIND SO REMOVING TAILWIND FROM THE PROJECT WILL NOT EFFECT IT. ***

### **I just want to use the navbar as is.**
Great! You can swap the logo out in `header.php` and edit the links in WP admin. Happy coding!

### **Ok so I like it, but I wanna tweak some things.**
Well, head over to `/assets/src/sass/components/_navbar.scss`. Notice at the top there's some SCSS variables with comments. These are some "hotfix" style things you can edit such as width, height, breakpoint, colors, etc. If you can't accomplish what you are looking to do via those, you'll need to jump into the code to make your changes. I've commented as well as I can for you. Happy Coding!

### **Nah I've got my own navbar, can I use that?**
Sure. It's your project and I didn't include malware with this install to tell me whether you tampered with the navbar or not. To get rid of it and add your own:
1. Delete everything out of `/assets/src/sass/components/_navbar.scss`. I don't see a reason why you wouldn't just replace it with your new css, but if you want to delete the file you can.
2. Delete all the code in `header.php` FROM `<section class="navigation">` through `</section>`. Leave the rest alone.
3. You might need to edit functions.php as well, depending on to what extext you are pruging the navbar. 

Good luck with your own navbar! I'd recommend you follow this pattern but it really up to you. Again, malware free over here.
1. Get the navbar working independent of your project, in codepen or something. Eliminates a lot of "is this not working because the code is wrong or because the project is messing it up?"
2. Import it in, and get it working static. meaning no php, none of that. Once you see that the navbar is working perfectly...
3. Convert it to wordpress. How to do that is beyond the scope of this readme, but there are plenty of resources online to help. Don't fall into the trap of saying you don't need to convert it. You do. It'll save you and your clients a headache in the future.

# Footer - Footer.php
Footers. Are they as bad as navbars? No. Are they at least easy to work with? Also no. Much like headers, they are already finicky enough without creating them in wordpress.

Wait, what do you mean "in wordpress"? I mean instead of a bunch of HTML that probably consists of `<footer>` and `<ul>` and such, you have a block of php that renders out some of the footer. Unlike the navbar, only part of the footer will be generated by Wordpress, namely because there is more to a footer than links. However, the links will be generated from Wordpress. We do it this way for a few reasons:
1. Your footer isn't much good if the URL's are only work on local or production, but not both. When PHP can't change them dynamically, you have to pick one or the other. 
2. Ideally your end user (client) would be able to change thier own footer and not need you to update it for them right? And even if they don't want to do that, it'll be a quick change. Like that magic act. 

So when we build this in wordpress, it is giong to generate some classes. However, unlike the navbar, we can use the CSS to work with these, as I've done here. The footer is set up and ready to go. It will need edited to make sure it looks the way you like, and adjustments for size will need to be made.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS NAVBAR DOES NOT USE TAILWIND SO REMOVING TAILWIND FROM THE PROJECT WILL NOT EFFECT IT.**

### **I just want to use the footer as is.**
Good. She's a beaut, Clark. You'll need to make a few adjustments. 
1. Go to footer.php. 
2. Update the logo, then adjust the scss to make the image look good and feel spaced right.
3. Update the phone number and name.
4. Change the links in WP admin.
5. Update the company text and copyright
6. Change the socials and add / remove any ones you do / don't need. 
7. Don't change anything else, you'll break stuff you don't mean to. 

### **Ok so I like it, but I wanna tweak some things.**
Doesn't surprise me. The nature of the way it was built means that you'll probably have to do some light editing even if you want to keep it the same.  Anyway to edit it just navigate to `/assets/src/sass/components/_footer.scss` and start changing things. I've commented as well as I can. Good luck and Happy Coding!

### **Nah I've got my own footer, can I use that?**
Figures ðŸ™„. Do what you must. 
1. Delete everything out of `/assets/src/sass/components/_navbar.scss`. I don't see a reason why you wouldn't just replace it with your new css, but if you want to delete the file you can.
2. Delete all the code in `footer.php` FROM the end of the opening php on line 12 to `<?php wp_footer(); ?>`. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T DELETE THAT, WORDPRESS NEEDS IT TO WORK. 
3. You might need to edit functions.php as well (the menus section), depending on to what extent you are purging the navbar. 

Good luck with your own footer! I'd recommend you follow this pattern but it really up to you. 
1. Get the footer working independent of your project, in codepen or something. Eliminates a lot of "is this not working because the code is wrong or because the project is messing it up?"
2. Import it in, and get it working static. meaning no php, none of that. Once you see that the navbar is working perfectly...
3. Convert it to wordpress. How to do that is beyond the scope of this readme, but there are plenty of resources online to help. Don't fall into the trap of saying you don't need to convert it. You do. It'll save you and your clients a headache in the future. 

Happy coding!
