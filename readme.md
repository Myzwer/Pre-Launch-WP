Wordpress Pre-Launch is a VERY beginnger friendly wordpress template built on webpack. It makes use of webpack, Babel, Sass, Tailwind, Browsersync, PostCSS, ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier and more. And if you have no idea what any of that is, then this is the template for you.

(I'm still a Work In Progress!)

## Features and Benefits

**General**
- [**Webpack.**](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/webpack) Built on webpack, this template allows for a modern development workflow + a production ready build.
- **Minification.** Complete with webpack's native features and CSSNano, this gets your CSS and JS files smaller than things in 40 degree water.
- [**Prettier.**](https://prettier.io/) An opinionated code formatter. It automagically formats all your code on save so that it always looks the same. This forces everyone's code to look the same, so no more arguing about tabs vs spaces.
- [**BrowserSync.**](https://browsersync.io/) Browsersync synchronises browsers, URLs, interactions and code changes across devices and automatically refreshes all the browsers on all devices on changes. If you have never used this it'll blow your mind. 
- [**Sourcemaps.**]() Webpack generates sourcemaps for all js and css files. This helps with debugging simply because when you don't have them enabled your code hides from you like slenderman. 

**CSS**
- [**PostCSS.**](http://postcss.org/) PostCSS allows for some code to be injected after the fact, most noteably...
- [**Autoprefixer.**](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) Remember those CSS vendor prefixes you didn't add? Well autoprefixer has you covered. 
- [**TailwindCSS.**](https://tailwindcss.com/) Tailwind is the CSS framework all the kids are tweeting about. If you aren't familiar, it basically generates like 4.8 million CSS classes so you never have to write CSS again. And it cleans up after itself, which is nice.
- [**Sass.**](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/sass-loader/) Compiles Sass down into CSS so browsers can read it.

**JS**
- [**BabelJS.**](https://babeljs.io/) Allows you to use next gen Javascript by transpiling it (dumbing it down) to something IE 4 can understand (that claim isn't tested).

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

### Hey. I'm Josh.

I am not at all qualified to be making something like this to teach new people, yet here I am, making it. This template has 2 major sections, depending on what you need. 

---

# Section 1: I Know What I'm Doing.

Alright you know what to do.
```bash
# 1-- Set up a local instance of Worpress in Local or something.
# 2-- Clone this into your themes folder (as a new theme)

$ git clone https://github.com/Myzwer/Pre-Launch-WP.git

# 2-- Edit the BrowserSync settings in `webpack.config.js`. Ya can't miss it. 
# 3-- Install yarn and all the project dependencies

$ yarn install

# 4-- Run a command and start making some magic.
yarn dev 
yarn dev:watch
yarn prod
yarn prod:watch
```
# Section 2: Lol I have no idea what I'm doing.

Good. You're like me. This guide aims to be pretty extensive, so buckle up. Some of this might already be up and running on your machine, and that's great, but this guide assumes you are starting from scratch. If you haven't gathered it already, I have a pretty unique sense of humor, but hopefully it makes this more fun to read. Or maybe Comedy Central will give me a call if this doesn't work out.

Couple Notes before we start:
- I am developing on a MacBook Pro running Catalina. If you are developing on a mac, everything should be the same, but Windows users might have other issues. At this time I do not have the bandwidth to check for issues / incompatibilities on windows. Sorry. :(
- If the rest of this seems hella incomplete, it probably is. I am currently pushing new commits pretty frequently, and so guides will come with that.
- While the aim of this guide is to help users get set up as much as possible, I am not going to cover how to build out a complete theme in WordPress. The goal is to get you from 0 to a working template, then run on your own.

Nothing yet. Sorry if you found this already. Lotta hype for nothing.
