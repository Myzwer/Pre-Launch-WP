   * If you're familiar with the way a previous version worked, Tailwind no longer purges CSS, rather it uses a
   * new feature called JIT (just in time) to call the CSS as needed as opposed to purging after the fact.
   *

      /* How to Add custom Colors
       * Give your color a name, make it something that makes sense.
       * If you aren't going to use the colors below, delete them.
       *
       * Default is the normal base color.
       * Light / Dark are variants within the same palette
       * Classes are named text-CLASSNAME
